# lhoraire

Time Management for Work and Study.

This is the algorithm backend submodule used in [lhoraire-web](https://github.com/code-Yking/lhoraire-web)

Needs _scipy_ to run the program.
~~Requires _mathplotlib_ and _pandas_ to run demo.py~~

Demo removed. Perhaps make a visit to https://lhoraire.work/ ?
